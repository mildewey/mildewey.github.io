    description: >
      You tap into the indomitable energy of the Berserk, replacing thought with
      instinct and hesitation with unbridled savagery.  Immediately and at the
      beginning of each turn, you may expend focus to intensify the Rage. For
      each focus spent, increase the impact of your attacks by 1 until the start
      of your next turn. The effect ends early if you spend no focus at the
      start of your turn. At the end of each of your turns, gain temporary
      Defense equal to the damage you inflicted. This temporary Defense is
      replaced at the end of your next turn. To maintain concentration, you must
      spend all your focus at the beginning of your turn.
