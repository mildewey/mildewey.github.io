  sections:
  - heading: Battle Board
    description: >
      The battle board is a 5x6 board divided into two 5x3 sections. Each section
      is controlled by one team of combatants. All combatants must end their turn
      on their side of the Battle Board. If a row adjacent to one side's section
      is left empty by the enemy at the end of their turn, the side may move up
      and occupy that row, taking it from the enemy and adding it to their own
      section.
  - heading: Sides and Turns
    description: >
      Each side is made up of several combatants -- typically several characters
      controlled by the players on one side and a combination of Mobs, Elites, and
      Bosses on the other. During combat, each side takes turns going. Each creature
      on a side takes two actions during their sides' turn in any order -- the
      players can either tactically decide who will go first or allow the player
      that knows what they want to do earliest go first. For each side, the beginning
      of a round of combat starts with their turn and continues until the enemy
      has completed their turns.
  - heading: Initiative
    description: >
      At the beginning of combat, the two sides roll a d12 each and compare the
      number (rerolling on a match). The side with the highest number can choose
      whether to go first or second. The second team arranges their combatants.
      The first team then arranges their combatants and takes half a turn, each
      combatant taking only one action each -- unless they double down on the action.
      Then the second team takes a full turn and both teams continue taking full
      turns until combat has been decided by one side losing all combatants.
  - heading: Combatants
    description: >
      Every participant in a fight is a combatant, but not all combatants are created equal.

      <i>Characters</i> have a large number of powers and abilities. They use
      focus and energy resources to have dynamic and powerful actions.

      <i>Mobs</i> have simple powers and abilities. They do not use focus or
      energy resources so the GM can manage several at once.

      <i>Elites</i> have more complex abilities. Some of their abilities use
      energy and they have energy scores.

      <i>Bosses</i> have complex abilities like Characters and both energy
      and focus resources along with powers that may use those resources.
  - heading: Stats
    description: >
      Each combatant has 4 stats: Speed, Evasion, Defense, and Resilience.
      Some combatants have Focus and Energy as well.
    sections:
    - heading: Speed
      description: >
        All combatants gain movement points at the beginning of their turn equal
        to their speed. Movement points are lost at the end of their turn.
    - heading: Evasion
      description: >
        When an attack is made against a target, the hit dice must roll higher
        than the target's evasion to count as a hit.
    - heading: Defense
      description: >
        Each combatant has a set of Defense tokens to use in resisting attacks.
        Each defense token has a value equal to the defense stat of the combatant.
    - heading: Resilience
      description: >
        Each combatant has a number of defense tokens equal to their Resilience
        at the start of combat.
    - heading: Focus
      description: >
        Focus is the number of Focus points that a combatant gains at the start
        of each round of combat. Focus points can be used to reroll hit dice
        when making an attack, to increase the Defense stat against a single
        incoming attack, or converted into movement points. Focus is also frequently
        used to maintain some powers or use certain types of actions.
    - heading: Energy
      description: >
        Energy is the number of Energy points that a combatant gains at the start
        of each combat. Energy points can be used to double down or trigger
        certain powerful actions.
  - heading: Actions
    description: >
      There are 4 kinds of actions: Attack, Tactics, Guard, and Move. Each turn,
      combatants can take 2 actions. Each action must be of a different kind
      than the other.
    sections:
    - heading: Attack
      description: >
        The combatant makes an attack against one or more combatants. If the
        target's defenses are broken, the effect of the attack is applied
        to the target. See the section on resolving attacks for more details.
    - heading: Tactics
      description: >
        Tactics actions frequently manage resources. When they include attacks
        the attack only needs to tap a defense token to apply the effect, unlike
        Attack actions that need to break the target's defenses to apply the
        effect.
    - heading: Guard
      description: >
        Guard actions generally make it harder for enemies to attack, or punish
        enemies for taking certain actions. Guard actions never include attacks.
    - heading: Move
      description: >
        Move actions are NOT required to move. Move actions instead increase
        the amount of movement a combatant can take or gives the combatant special
        movement types that allow them to ignore certain kinds of terrain.
    - heading: Doubling Down
      description: >
        A combatant can take a third action on their turn by Doubling Down. To
        double down, the combatant must spend an energy point. The combatant may
        then take an action of one of the types they have already taken. The action
        may not be identical to one of the other actions unless it has the repeatable tag.
    - heading: Basic Actions
      description: >
        All creatures can use the basic actions: Strike, Aid, Recover, Reposition.
  - heading: Resolving Attacks
    description: >
      Both attack actions and tactics actions usually involve making an attack
      on a target. The action description indicates a number of dice to roll
      in an equation to determine the Attack Value. The dice and their equation
      are expressed like this: 3d*4+1. In this case, 3 12-sided dice would be rolled.
      Each die would be compared to the target's evasion. If the die value is
      greater than the target's evasion, the die counts as a hit. Rolls of
      11 or 12 are automatically hits. The number of hits is then multipled
      by 3 and then 1 is added to the total to calculate the Attack Value.

      The Attack Value is compared to the target's Defense stat. If it is greater
      than the target's attack value, the target's defenses are broken. If it
      is 0 or less, the target ignores the attack. If it is between 1 and the
      Defense stat, the target must either tap a defense token, or discard a
      tapped defense token. If the target's defense is broken, the target must
      discard 1 untapped defense token, or 2 tapped defense tokens.
    sections:
    - heading: Patterns
      description: >
        By default, attacks target a single target. Some attacks can target
        multiple targets. The pattern of the attack determines how to determine
        the targets that can be attacked. The origin of the attack must be adjacent
        to or on the combatant's Movement Path in a turn.
      sections:
      - heading: Scatter
        description: >
          Make up to 3 attacks against separate targets.
      - heading: Flurry
        description: >
          Make up to 3 attacks against the same or separate targets.
      - heading: Line
        description: >
          All Targets in a row.
      - heading: Burst
        description: >
          All targets in a 3x3 square.
      - heading: Path
        description: >
          All targets along your movement path. You can move through enemies.
      - heading: Wave
        description: >
          All targets in 3 columns.
    - heading: Effects
      description: >
        Many attacks and tactics actions have effects. When an effect is applied
        to a combatant the effect either has an immediate consequence, or an effect
        token is given to the combatant to be handled on the combatant's turn.
        Effect tokens can only be resolved or used one at a time. If multiple effect
        tokens of the same kind could be triggered, the others add duration to the
        effect, causing it to be triggered again at the next time the effect would
        be triggered. The possible effects are: Weakened, Confused, Vulnerable,
        Hobbled, Stunned, Poisoned, Wounded, Heroic, Lucky, Invigorated.
      sections:
      - heading: Weakened
        description: >
          When you make an attack, reduce the Attack Value by 1 for each Weakened
          token and then discard a Weakened token.
      - heading: Vulnerable
        description: >
          When you are attacked, add 1 to the Attack Value for each Vulnerable
          token you have and then discard a Vulnerable token.
      - heading: Hobbled
        description: >
          Reduce the number of movement points you get at the start of your turn
          by 1 for each Hobbled token you have and then discard a Hobbled token.
      - heading: Stunned
        description: >
          You can only take a single action on your turn and then discard a Stunned
          token. You can still double down on that action.
      - heading: Poisoned
        description: >
          Tap or break a defense token at the start of your turn and then discard
          a Poisoned token.
      - heading: Wound
        description: >
          Tap or break an additional token when this effect is applied.
      - heading: Heroic
        description: >
          At the start of your turn you may discard a Heroic token to eliminate
          another token before it has any effect.
      - heading: Invigorated
        description: >
          You may double down without spending Energy. The action does not have to
          have the repeatable tag to use an identical action. After doubling down
          like this, discard an Invigorated token.
  - heading: Movement
    description: >
      Regardless of what actions you do, your character gains movement points
      equal to their Speed at the start of their turn. Focus points can be converted
      into movement points. Move actions only augment movement. The path of movement
      determines where a combatant can apply actions and the patterns of those actions.
      The combatant defines a movement path that uses some or all of their movement
      points. After the movement is over, the combatant snaps back to their point
      of origin unless their movement path ends in their section of the Battle Board. 
    sections:
    - heading: Terrain
      description: >
        Most spaces on the combat board only cost 1 movement point to enter. The
        type of terrain can modify this. A character moves using their movement
        points and then snaps back to where they started if they end their movement
        in a space on the enemy side of the board. The path of their movement
        determines where they can apply actions and the patterns of those actions.
      sections:
      - heading: Difficult Terrain
        description: >
          Difficult Terrain costs an extra movement point to enter.
      - heading: Challenging Terrain
        description: >
          Challenging Terrain cannot be moved through, but movement actions frequently
          remove this restriction.
      - heading: Barrier Terrain
        description: >
          Barrier Terrain cannot be moved through.
      - heading: Hazardous Terrain
        description: >
          Combatants must tap or discard a defense token to move through Hazardous Terrain.
      - heading: Obscuring Terrain
        description: >
          Attacks targeting or originating from obscuring terrain roll one fewer
          hit die.
      - heading: Liquid Terrain
        description: >
          Liquid Terrain costs an extra movement point to enter. Attacks targeting or
          originating from liquid derrain roll one fewer hit die.
      - heading: Elevated Terrain
        description: >
          Elevated Terrain costs two extra movement points to enter unless entering
          from Elevated Terrain of the same or higher levels. Multiple levels of
          Elevated Terrain can be designated in a combat. Elevated Terrain counts
          as being adjacent to lower terrain but lower terrain does not count as
          being adjacent to elevated terrain for the purpose of determining whether
          and effect can be used from a space.
      - heading: Zone of Control
        description: >
          All combatants generate a '+' shaped zone of control around them including
          their own space. Each space in the zone of control requires an extra
          movement point to enter for enemies. Many special actions modify the
          effects of the Zone of Control. Multiple Zones of Control that overlap
          stack their effects.
    - heading: Special Movement
      description: >
        Move actions and passives allow certain combatants to ignore terrain types.
        Specific actions may give specific benefits, but some movement types are
        common enough to be named and defined: Flight, Swimming, Climbing, and Teleportation
      sections:
      - heading: Flight
        description: >
          Combatants with flight ignore other combatants' Zone of Control unless
          those combatants also have flight. Flight ignores Difficult Terrain,
          Elevated Terrain and Challenging Terrain. Flight allows the combatant
          to ignore the movement penalty of Liquid Terrain, but the combatant
          cannot benefit from reducing the attack hit dice that enter the terrain.
      - heading: Swimming
        description: >
          Combatants with Swimming can ignore Liquid Terrain.
      - heading: Climbing
        description: >
          Combatants with Climbing can treat Elevated terrain of higher levels
          as difficult terrain instead of Elevated terrain.
      - heading: Bull Rush
        description: >
          Combatants can ignore the movement penalty of Zone of Control, but may
          be subject to other Zone of Control effects.
      - heading: Teleportation
        description: >
          Teleportation is expressed in a number of spaces that a combatant may skip
          during their movement. Spaces that are skipped are removed from the Path
          of Movement. Teleportation cannot skip Barriers. It cannot skip Obscuring
          terrain, but it can bypass Liquid Terrain. It ignores all other Terrain
          types. It costs 1 movement point to enter the space on the other side
          of the teleport, regardless of the type of terrain entered. Multiple
          teleportation points can be used simultaneously to skip several spaces
          or broken up to skip multiple times in any combination of spaces that
          adds up to the number of teleportation points.
- name: Building a Character
  sections:
  - heading: Class
    description: >
      Each character must choose a class. A class is built from two archetypes.
      Each Archetype grants a set of base powers and a set of upgrades. All base
      powers from each Archetype are available to the character from the beginning
      of the game.
  - heading: Affinities
    description: >
      Each character has four Affinities: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. A character
      starts with 1 in each affinity and gets 6 affinity points. Each affinity
      point may be used to increase an affinity by 1. The affinities are used
      to calculate the basic stats of the character: Speed, Evasion, Defense,
      Resilience, Focus, and Energy.
    sections: >
    - heading: Speed
      description: Speed is equal to Air + Earth.

  - heading: Equipment
    description: >
      In addition to actions granted by a character's class, actions can be gained
      by using equipment. Equipment can also grant boosts to the basic stats of
      the character or passive effects as well.
    sections: >
    - heading: Weapons
      description: >
        Each weapon has a designation as a Primary Weapon or a Secondary Weapon.
        A character may equip one Primary Weapon and one Secondary Weapon or
        three Secondary weapons at a time. All the actions associated with the
        weapons are active simultaneously, there is no need to declare that a
        weapon is being wielded during combat. However, the set of weapons equipped
        cannot be changed during combat.
    - heading: Armor
      description: >
        Each character can choose to wear Light, Medium or Heavy armor. Light
        armor grants +1 evasion. Medium armor grants +1 defense. Heavy armor
        grants +1 evasion and +1 defense, but also -1 Speed.
  - heading: Leveling Up
    description: >
      At the GM's discretion, characters may level up at points in time throughout
      the campaign. A character may level up one or more times at the time of
      creation -- we recommend that a character levels up once at character creation.
      When a character levels up, they gain 1 Affinity point and unlock one of their
      10 upgrades.
