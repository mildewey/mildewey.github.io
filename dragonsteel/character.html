<h1>Building a Character</h1>
<p>
  Building a character consists of selecting stats, archetypes, and upgrades.
  As a character levels up, they gain new stats (2 points per level) and upgrades
  (1 per level). The GM will decide what level the campaign starts at, from 0 to 10.
</p>
<h3>Stats</h3>
<p>
  A character has 6 combat stats: Speed, Evasion, Defense, Resilience, Energy,
  and Focus. See the section on Combat for more details about what these stats do.
  To build your character, you get 30 points to allocate in the stats, plus 2
  points per level. All stats are important to all characters, so be sure to
  allocate at least a few points to each stat.
<p>
<h3>Archetypes</h3>
<p>
  A character takes 2 archetypes. Each archetype grants a character a set of base
  actions and opens up a set of upgrades the character can take as they level up.
</p>
<h3>Upgrades</h3>
<p>
  Each archetype has a set of 5 upgrades. Between the two archetypes a character
  selects, they'll be able to take one of these 10 upgrades each level. Upgrades
  are passive abilities that enhance the actions a character can take or allow
  the character to bend or break specific rules.
